# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! This project contains my solutions to the annual Advent of Code programming challenges. My goal is always to learn, so you might notice noticeable differences between the first days and the last days of any given year.

## 🚀 Project Structure

This repository is organized by year, with each year containing solutions for that year's puzzles. The solutions are implemented in [Rust (2021)](https://github.com/Sheepsody/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021) and [C++ (2023)](https://github.com/Sheepsody/advent-of-code/tree/main/2023/).

## 📊 Progress and Cumulative Solve Time

Here's a table showing the progress and cumulative time to solve for each year (benchmarks are done on a Macbook M2 pro - single threaded):

| Year | Lang | Stars | Cumulative Time |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 2023 | C++  | 50/50 |  |
| 2021 | Rust | 50/50 | 281 ms |

## 💻 Running the Solutions

To run a specific solution:

1. Navigate to the year and day of the puzzle you want to run.
2. Execute the year's command

```bash
# 2021 Rust
# Run solution
cargo aoc -d [day]
# Benchmark
cargo aoc bench -d [day]
```

## 🤝 Contributing

While this repository primarily contains my personal solutions, feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.

Happy coding, and enjoy the Advent of Code challenges! 🎅🏼🌟
